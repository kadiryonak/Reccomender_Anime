Anime Recommender System
Welcome to the Anime Recommender System project! This repository contains a set of algorithms designed to recommend anime to users based on their preferences. The system employs collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and a hybrid approach to provide personalized anime recommendations.

Project Overview
This repository aims to develop an accurate and efficient anime recommender system using various recommendation techniques. The Anime Recommender System leverages collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches to suggest anime based on user preferences and anime features. The project is built using Python and popular libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn.

Dataset Information
The dataset for this project includes user ratings and anime information. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, duplicates, and to normalize the data. The preprocessing steps ensure that the data is clean and ready for training the recommendation models.

Features
Collaborative filtering using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Content-based filtering using TF-IDF and cosine similarity
Hybrid recommendation system combining collaborative and content-based methods
User interaction for personalized recommendations
Prerequisites
Before you can run the project, you'll need to install the following software:

Python 3.x
pandas
scikit-learn
scipy
Installation
